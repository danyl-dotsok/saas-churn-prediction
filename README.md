# SaaS Customer Churn Prediction

## Business Context
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a SaaS subscription-based product.
The service is used by business users and operates on a recurring subscription model.
A user is considered churned if they do not renew their subscription within a defined period.
The goal of this project is to identify users who are likely to churn based on historical usage and account data.
This allows the business to take proactive retention actions and reduce revenue loss.

## Problem Statement
The task is formulated as a binary classification problem, where the objective is to predict whether a user will churn or not.
The model outputs the probability of churn for each user.

## Data Overview
Each row in the dataset represents a single user.
The dataset includes information about user activity, subscription details, support interactions, and engagement metrics.
The target variable is the churn indicator.

## Project Pipeline
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Model comparison and selection
5. Results interpretation and conclusions

## Evaluation Metric
The primary evaluation focus is on identifying users who are at high risk of churn.
Metrics are selected with business impact in mind.
